# Installation Guide

Follow these steps to install ChainFruit AI on your system:

## Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/ChainFruitAI.git
```

## Navigate to the Project Directory

```shell
cd ChainFruitAI
```

## Install Required Dependencies

### GCC and Clang

Depending on your operating system, you can typically install GCC and Clang using your system's package manager:

- For Ubuntu:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install gcc clang
  ```

- For CentOS:

  ```shell
  sudo yum install gcc clang
  ```

### Python

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use your system's package manager.

### Machine Learning Libraries

Install the required Python libraries using `pip`:

```shell
pip install tensorflow pytorch scikit-learn
```

### C Programming Language

If you don't have GCC for C installed, you can install it using your system's package manager:

- For Ubuntu:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install gcc
  ```

- For CentOS:

  ```shell
  sudo yum install gcc
  ```

### Rust Programming Language

Install Rust from the official website:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
